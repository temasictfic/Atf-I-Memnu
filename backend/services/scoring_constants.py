"""Score thresholds and weights shared across the backend.

The status-band thresholds at the top of this file are mirrored in
``src/renderer/src/lib/constants/scoring.ts`` (UI needs them to render
status pills). The scoring weights below are backend-only — the renderer
displays composite scores produced here but never recomputes them.

Bands:
- score >= STATUS_FOUND_THRESHOLD       → "found"       (UI: High / Yüksek)
- score >= STATUS_PROBLEMATIC_THRESHOLD → "problematic" (UI: Medium / Orta)
- otherwise                              → "not_found"   (UI: Low / Düşük)

# A reference's ``parse_confidence`` reflects how cleanly source-extraction
# pulled fields out of raw text. Two well-known cutoffs drive downstream
# behaviour:
#   < LOW  → NER fallback to regex extractor; orchestrator searches with
#            extracted title only; match_scorer drops the author signal
#            from the composite to avoid penalising on misparsed authors.
#   ≥ HIGH → crossref enables the disambiguating ``query.author`` filter;
#            below this, author tokens are too noisy to filter on.
