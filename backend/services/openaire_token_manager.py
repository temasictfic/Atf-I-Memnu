"""OpenAIRE refresh-token exchange and short-lived access-token cache.

Anonymous OpenAIRE is capped at 60 req/hour (one call per minute sliding
window) which is nowhere near enough for a 40-PDF batch. A registered user
can lift that cap to 7,200 req/hour by pasting a refresh token into Settings.

Refresh tokens expire 1 month after issuance; access tokens expire 1 hour.
We therefore:

- persist only the **refresh token** (in `settings.api_keys["openaire"]`),
- exchange it lazily for an access token on demand, cached in memory until
  60 s before expiry,
- if the exchange response rotates the refresh token (OpenAIRE's docs
  indicate this can happen), write the new one back to settings and bump
  `openaire_token_saved_at` so the UI warns at the correct time.

The verifier calls :func:`get_access_token` before each request and falls
back to anonymous if it returns ``None`` — the app stays usable even when
the user has not connected, has typo'd their token, or OpenAIRE is down.
